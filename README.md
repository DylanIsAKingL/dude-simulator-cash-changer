# Is This Safe?

Yes, its completely open source meaning you can compile it yourself.

# Usage
**NOTE: This requires [Dude Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/654990/Dude_Simulator/)**

Just install .exe from the releases tab or you can compile it yourself, open it and dude simulator.

# Useless information
